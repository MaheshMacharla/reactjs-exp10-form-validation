1. Form Validation (Error Message Displayed)

When the user submits the form with a password shorter than 6 characters, a validation error message is shown below the password input field in red:
❗️Password must be at least 6 characters

This ensures users meet the basic password security requirement before proceeding.

2. Form Submitted Successfully

After entering a valid email and a strong password (6+ characters), the form submits successfully. A JavaScript alert appears showing the message:
✅ Form submitted successfully!

This confirms that client-side validations were passed and data submission was successful.
